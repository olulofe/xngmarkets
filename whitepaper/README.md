## **Abstract**

**xNG.markets** tokenizes Nigeria’s blue-chip equities as **KYC-gated Hedera Tokens (HTS)** backed 1:1 by real NGX shares held with a **SEC-approved broker** and custodied at **CSCS** under a **BVI SPV**.
Each token (e.g., `xNGX-MTNN`) mirrors its underlying stock, with prices and volatility bands published through an on-chain **OracleHub** via the **Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)**.

The protocol allows:

* 24/7 secondary trading via a **Central Limit Order Book (CLOB)**
* **Primary Mint/Burn windows** during NGX trading hours
* **On-chain dividends** paid in **USDC-H (USD)**
* Borrowing and supplying USDC against xNG holdings

xNG operates under the **SEC Regulatory Incubation Program (Sandbox)** — providing a compliant, transparent gateway for diaspora and global investors to access Nigeria’s $60B stock market.

---

## **Introduction**

Nigeria’s stock market is one of Africa’s largest, but retail and diaspora participation remains constrained by outdated infrastructure, opaque pricing, and local-only compliance hurdles.

Today, investors must open accounts with brokers, often waiting **up to three days** for activation, while the market itself trades only **10:00am–2:30pm (Mon–Fri)**. Diaspora investors face additional restrictions under NIN-based KYC, leaving over **15 million Nigerians abroad** without access to NGX stocks.

xNG.markets bridges this gap by bringing regulated NGX assets to Hedera — enabling 24/7 access, real-time price transparency, and programmable on-chain yield.

---

## **Market Opportunity**

* **NGX Market Cap:** $50–65B (Top 3 in Africa)
* **Annual Diaspora Remittances:** $20.9B (2024, CBN Data)
* **Global Tokenized Assets:** $185B (0% African exposure)
* **Retail Crypto Users in Nigeria:** 28M+ (Statista, 2024)

Tokenizing Nigeria’s dividend-paying blue-chips unlocks new channels for domestic and diaspora wealth participation, introduces liquidity to traditionally illiquid equities, and positions Hedera as the home for **Africa’s compliant RWA ecosystem**.

## **Product Overview**

xNG offers a **regulated hybrid market** for tokenized Nigerian equities.

| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **xNGX Tokens**         | HTS assets representing NGX blue-chip shares (e.g., `xNGX-GTCO`) |

| **CLOB**                | Non-custodial secondary trading with price-band enforcement      |
| **BorrowSupplyV1**      | Lending pool allowing 50% LTV borrowing against xNG collateral   |
| **DirectSettleAdapter** | Atomic settlement between buyers/sellers in USDC and xNG         |
| **Proof of Reserves**   | Monthly reconciliation of CSCS holdings vs. on-chain supply      |

**Dividend Flow:**
Issuer → Broker → Protocol → Token Holders (paid in USDC-H).

## **Architecture Overview**

**Three-Layer Design**

**User Layer**
→ xNG DApp (trade, borrow, portfolio)
→ Funding via USDC/Fiat
→ Wallets (social login + KYC integration)

**Protocol Layer**
→ OracleHub (iNAV, Band)
→ CLOB (order book)
→ DirectSettleAdapter (settlement)
→ BorrowSupplyV1 (lending)

**Infrastructure Layer**
→ Hedera Token Service (xNG + USDC-H)
→ Hedera Consensus Service (oracle messages)
→ Mirror Node (real-time transparency)
→ Fireblocks SDK + Custodian Wallets

*(Illustrated in the updated “xNG Architecture Diagram” version.)*

---

## **Market Data & OracleHub**

The **OracleHub** aggregates vendor feeds and computes an **Indicative NAV (iNAV)** plus a **Dynamic Band** — a volatility-sensitive range that constrains all primary and secondary trades.

* **iNAV Update Frequency:** ~180 seconds
* **Band Width:** Calculated from volatility (σ) and depth metrics
* **HCS Publishing:** `{price, band, seq, ts, signatures}`
* **Validation:** Contracts verify signature, sequence, and freshness
* **Fallbacks:** Stale data triggers CLOB pause or RFQ mode

Example:
If `xNGX-MTNN` iNAV = ₦280, Band = ±1.2%, valid orders = ₦276.64–₦283.36.

---

## **Trading Flows**

### **Primary Mint (USD → Shares → xNG)**

* User specifies amount and tolerance (−5% to +2.5%)
* Broker executes on NGX via SPV custody
* Protocol mints `xNGX-{ticker}` to user wallet

### **Primary Burn (xNG → Shares → USD)**

* User transfers tokens to escrow
* Broker sells underlying shares during NGX hours
* Protocol remits **USDC-H** net of fees

### **Secondary Trading (CLOB)**

* Continuous order book with price–time priority
* Only valid **inside-band** orders execute
* Settlement via DirectSettleAdapter
* Fees: 0.2–0.5% per side (in USDC-H)

---

## **Borrow & Supply (Lending)**

* **Collateral:** xNG tokens
* **Borrow Limit:** 60% LTV (liquidation at 70%)
* **Supply:** USDC-H earns dynamic APY
* **Fees:** 0.1% origination, 2% liquidation
* **Liquidations:** NGX window only, via broker execution

Borrowers access short-term liquidity without selling, while suppliers earn stable yields from utilization of the USDC pool.

---

## **Dividends & Proof of Reserves**

**Dividends:**
Distributed on-chain in USDC-H within T+1 after broker credit confirmation.

**Proof of Reserves:**
Independent auditor (per Freesia opinion) compares:

* CSCS statement (off-chain)
* On-chain total supply
  Attestation (PDF + hash) published monthly to xNG Portal.

If mismatch >0.1%, primary windows automatically pause pending reconciliation.

---

## **Compliance & Regulatory Pathway**
